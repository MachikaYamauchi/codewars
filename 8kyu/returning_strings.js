// Make a function that will return a greeting statement that uses an input; your program should return, "Hello, <name> how are you doing today?".

// [Make sure you type the exact thing I wrote or the program may not execute properly]

// My solution
// Parameter: string, ("", " ")
// return

function greet(name){
    return `Hello, ${name} how are you doing today?`;
    // return `${name}`
}

// greet("John") -> "Hello, John how are you doing today?"
// greet("Mary") -> "Hello, Mary how are you doing today?"
